### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tom, a Software Engineer based in Palo Alto, USA:

- I use C, Go, and Python daily.
- Now: building the future of digital privacy at [Anjuna](https://www.anjuna.io).
- Ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/app13y), or read more in the [official .pdf](./tom-appley-cv.pdf).
- Fun fact: sometimes I mix drinks; you've got a favorite?
