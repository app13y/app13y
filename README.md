### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tom, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area, USA:

- I use C, Go, and Python daily.
- Now: building the future of digital privacy at [Anjuna](https://www.anjuna.io).
- Ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/app13y), or read more in the [official .pdf](https://github.com/app13y/app13y/blob/cfbc5762f9cf9ed051576edee344aacd6c84bf09/tom-appley-cv.pdf).
- Fun fact: sometimes I mix drinks; you've got a favorite?
